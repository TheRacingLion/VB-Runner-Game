<h3>- Starting Up -</h3>

There are two ways to start the game:

- Download this repository and place the "Runner Game" folder into your Visual Basic projects folder and run it like a normal project (Opening the .sln file inside "Runner Game"). (Will be able to see code and how it was made)
<br />
- Download this repository and run the setup.exe file inside "Installer Setup" (This option will install all pre-requisits that are required to run the game if not already installed. First option is more advised because of this reason). (Will not be able to see how it was made)

<h3>- Preview -</h3>

If you do not wish to download or run anything and still want to see the game, here is a preview:<br />(I did say extremely simple at the top...)
